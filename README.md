## Enterprise Content & Licensing Solutions for Microsoft Power Platform

**Secure content. Enforceable licensing. Built for enterprise scale.**

CylApps delivers enterprise-grade solutions that extend the Microsoft Power Platform with
secure content management and commercially enforceable licensing.

Our products are designed for organizations that operate in regulated, high-compliance,
or large-scale environments — and for ISVs building commercial solutions on Power Platform.

## The Business Problem

Microsoft Power Platform accelerates application development, but enterprise and commercial
requirements often exceed native capabilities:

- Large files introduce security and performance risks
- Content governance is difficult to standardize
- Licensing enforcement is fragile or bypassable
- Offline or hybrid scenarios are poorly supported
- Compliance requires custom, high-risk implementations

**CylApps closes these gaps without breaking Microsoft-native architecture.**

## What We Deliver

### Content Management Hub (CMH)
A secure, scalable content layer for Power Platform applications.

**Business value**
- Supports very large files (10+ GB)
- Enforces confidentiality and role-based access
- Centralizes governance and auditability
- Reusable across Model-Driven Apps and Power Pages

---

### CMH Licensing Architecture
A commercial-grade licensing framework for Power Platform solutions.

**Enables**
- Enforceable licensing (not UI-based)
